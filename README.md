# Linked List

## Overview

This project is a JavaScript implementation of a singly linked list, built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. The implementation provides a fully functional linked list with operations for adding, removing, searching, and traversing nodes.

## Skills Learned

Through completing this project, I have demonstrated an understanding of:

- **Linked list fundamentals** - Created a formal representation of a LinkedList, added methods to manipulate its data
- **Pointer manipulation** - Managed node references when traversing through the list
- **Edge case handling** - Properly handled empty lists, single-node lists, etc.
